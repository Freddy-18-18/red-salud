# The Red Salud Senior Engineering Manifesto

We are not just writing code; we are building a life-saving infrastructure for healthcare. This requires a level of engineering excellence that matches the top 1% of Silicon Valley companies.

## 1. Zero Compromise on Quality
We ship code that is well-tested, strictly typed, and built to last. If it's not "Senior level", it doesn't get merged.

## 2. Speed as a Feature
Performance is not an afterthought. Every millisecond counts when a doctor is trying to access a patient record.

## 3. Privacy is Sacred
Medical data is the most sensitive data there is. We protect it with extreme prejudice.

## 4. Constant Evolution
The stack moves fast. We move faster. We embrace React 19, Next.js 16, and the latest in AI-assisted development.

## 5. Radical Transparency
We document why we make decisions, not just what we did. We communicate clearly and proactively.
